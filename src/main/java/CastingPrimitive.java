     * Casting is the conversion of one type to another. It exists for both primitive and object types.

     * the decimal portion of the number.
     *
     * If you try to just return d without changes, the method will not compile because d needs to be converted
     * to an int first to reflect the int return type.
     *
     * For example: int a = (int) 3.9;
     *              System.out.println(a); //will print 3 to the console.
     *
     * Now cast d to an int and return it.
     * @param d a decimal number.
     * @return the int form of d.
